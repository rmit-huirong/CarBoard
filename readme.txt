This is the assignment 1 of Advanced Programming Techniques in Semester 1, 2017.

Features on each file are as follows:

carboard.h and carboard.c: This is the main header and source files. The main 
method should be implemented in .c file.

board.h and board.c: These files include the declaration and body of the 
functions related to the board.

game.h and game.c: These files contain the body of the logic of the game. In 
addition to the provided function in the header file, you will need to use 
functional abstraction to break down the logic of the game into smaller functions.

player.h and player.c: These files contain functions related to specific actions
of the player.

helpers.h and helpers.c: These files are used to declare the variables and 
functions which are used throughout the system and are shared among multiple 
other modules. A very good example is the readRestOfLine() function which must 
be used for reading input from the player.

What I want to say:

	For assignment requirements, I tried to keep line lengths of code to a 
reasonable maximum such that they fit into 80 columns. In some cases they
look weird so I did not keep all of them exactly fit into 80 columns.

	It is a bit hard to break a function into small pieces because we need to 
pass a lot of parameters in order to use it but finally I succeed.

	I still keep the comments which have already existed in startup codes in 
.c file and .h file, which can make the functions easier to understand.

	Nothing special in my program. I just use some expressions to make it more 
attractive. Hope you enjoy it. :)
